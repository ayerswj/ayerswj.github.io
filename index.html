			<h1>Howdy!</h1>
			<p>I'm a hungry and enthusiastic Computer Scientist that is trying to break into the
				software development career field.  I am a goal oriented person that applies myself 100% to
				whatever I put my mind to.  I strive to find complex problems and reduce it into smaller
				achievable issues.
				<br><br>I am currently focusing my skills on backend REST API construction and consumption.
				I work with Java, C++, and Python primarily but can abapt to many other languages such as
				Swift, Javascript, or HTML/CSS when needed.  I hope to work in the computer security sector and help todo
				improve protocols that help the work.
