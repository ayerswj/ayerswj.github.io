			<h1>Me</h1>
			<p>I'm a hungry and enthusiastic Computer Scientist Senior at Texas State University that is trying to break into the
				software development career field.  I am a goal oriented person that applies myself 100% to
				whatever I put my mind to.  I strive to find complex problems and reduce it into smaller
				achievable issues.  I am also interested in open source ideology and look forward to contributing to them someday.
				I always keep an open mind when approaching obstacles which allows me to make subjective decisions on the fly.
